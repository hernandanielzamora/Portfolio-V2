          Hey there! I am Hern√°n Zamora, a passionate web developer with a
          knack for crafting innovative solutions. I am on the verge of earning
          my software engineering degree from the Technological University of
          Argentina. During my academic journey, I have honed my skills in
          cutting-edge technologies and best practices. I thrive on challenges
          and am unwaveringly committed to delivering top-notch results. With
          nearly 40 projects under my belt, I excel in JavaScript, React,
          Redux, Ruby on Rails, and more. I am always excited to embrace new
          challenges and stay at the forefront of industry trends. Beyond
          coding, I enjoy other activities like going to the gym, playing
          football and gaming, bringing a unique balance to my life. If you are
          looking for a web developer who injects energy, enthusiasm, and
          expertise into projects, your quest ends here!
